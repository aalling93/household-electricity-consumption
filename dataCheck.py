    %--------------------------------------------------
    % Description:
    
    The following function takes a file name as input.
    If the filename exist in the directory, the function is exited.
    Else, the function will keep on looping until a correct file name is given. 
    
    If the function is started by mistake, the user may stop the loop by writing 'stop loop' (without ' ').
    This will exit the loop, returning no output. The program is the executed.
    
    If a wrong filename is given, the function shows the .csv files in the dir. These are the allowed files to give. 
    
    After a correct filename is given, the user has to define the filling mode.
    For more information on the filling, see load_measurements();
    
    
    %---------------------------------------------------
    %Function input:
        No function input.
     Text input:
        Name of a .csv file in the same folder as the function. 
           - must be .csv
           - must exist in the same folder as the function
           - Dont use "" or '' when writing the file name
           - NOTE: if stop loop is used, the function is ended, and the options will be given again.
     fmode:
         - Way of filling the rows with errors. 
    %---------------------------------------------------
    %Output:
        data = A valid filename.
               The filename is a string with the extention .csv.
               The filename is placed in the same folder as the function.
